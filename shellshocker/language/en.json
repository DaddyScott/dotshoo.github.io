What should I do?", "a": "<p>If your shots are getting off really late, or you're bouncing around all over the place, here are a few things you can try:<ul><li>Close any other open tabs.</li><li>Pause or cancel any active downloads or streams. Turn off that cat video!</li><li>Close any file-sharing applications</li><li>Close apps that download in the background (Steam, etc.)</li><li>Try a different server</li><li>Restart your router</li><li>If you're on WiFi, try a wired connection if you can</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, we like to see a ping of 100ms or less. You can see your ping in the upper-right corner of the game window as you play. You can get away with higher pings if they're consistent. Lag spikes (when your ping momentarily shoots upward) will absolutely ruin your day, though, and there is unfortunately no way for the game to compensate for them.</p>" },

Now what?", "a": "<p>(Frame rate is indicated by the FPS readout in the upper-right corner of the game window. 60 is best!)</p><ul><li>Try closing other apps, browsers, and tabs</li><li>Open Settings and turn off Auto Detail, then un-check High Resolution and Shadows (if enabled)</li><li>If you're running multiple displays, try moving your browser window to another one</li><li>Install the latest video drivers for your card.
